# Machine Learning Projects

I took a Machine Learning course in NYU Shanghai and these are the projects I had to build in order to learn certain important concepts.   

I implemented simple ML models such as Support Vector Machines and Linear Regression in Numpy. Then for more complicated Deep Learning models such as CNN's, RNN's, as well as simple perceptron algorithms I used PyTorch.
